👩🏽‍💻 I am a Junior Full Stack Developer studying at Coder Academy Flex Track in Melbourne, Australia.

🌱 I have a very curious mind and am always willing to learn and try new things! My favourite thing to do in my spare time is box 🥊 or learn new ways to keep my plant babies alive 🌿

💌 Please don't hesitate to reach out and connect with me through my socials. Let's geek out together!
